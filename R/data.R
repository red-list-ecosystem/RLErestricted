#' Tropical glaciers on the Volcanos of Peru and Chile
#'
#' Outlines of tropical glaciers that are located in a volcanic region
#' between Peru and Chile. The original outlines come from the Randolph Glacier
#' Inventory (version 6.0). The subset of outlines has been selected based on
#' glacier groups suggested by Sagredo and Lowell (2012) and adopted by
#' Ferrer-Paris (2004).
