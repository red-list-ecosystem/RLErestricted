#' Tropical glaciers of the world
#'
#' Outlines of tropical glacier complexes that are located in tropical regions
#' of the world. The original outlines of the glacier complexes come from the
#' Randolph Glacier Inventory (version 7.0), but have been simplified to reduce
#' file size while preserving their topology. The subset of glacier complexes
#' has been selected based on glacier groups suggested by Sagredo and Lowell
#' (2012) and adopted by Ferrer-Paris (2004).
