\description{
Outlines of tropical glaciers that are located in a volcanic region
between Peru and Chile. The original outlines come from the Randolph Glacier
Inventory (version 6.0). The subset of outlines has been selected based on
glacier groups suggested by Sagredo and Lowell (2012) and adopted by
Ferrer-Paris (2004).
